# This execs whatever is provided as a COMMAND to the container. By default, as established
# in the image via the Dockerfile, it is scripts/start-server.sh
# This mechanism, though, allows us to run anything inside the container. We use this
# for running tests, mypy, black, etc. through docker compose.
# Note that surrounding $@ with double quote causes the expansion (which starts with
# parameter 1 not 0) to result in each parameter being retained without splitting.
# Sort of like "$@" -> "$1" "$2" "$3" ..

exec "$@"
