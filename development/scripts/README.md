## `generate-data-files.py`

A small tool, an example function really, to generate files for manual testing of upload and download. I use it by copy/pasting into a Python REPL session in the directory in which I want to generate files, and just run the function with the required parameters.

## `list-uploads.sh`

Handy for listing the contents of the `./data` directory while developing the `/upload` endpoint of the server locally. It simply lists the directory every 0.5s.

## `run`
